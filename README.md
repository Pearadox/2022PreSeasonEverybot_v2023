# 2022PreSeasonEverybot_v2023

After having learned basic FRC robot programming using Timed robot ([2022PreseasonEverybot_Timed](https://github.com/Pearadox/2022PreseasonEverybot_Timed)), our rookie programmers learned Command Based programming using a separate repo ([2022PreSeasonEverybot_Command](https://github.com/Pearadox/2022PreSeasonEverybot_Command)) and our 2022 Everybot.

Once the 2023 season started, we enhanced this code to prove we could engage the Charge Station automatically.  We then moved on to implementing a full autonomous period routine, but had problems we thought might be because we were still using the 2022 version of WPILib.  So, we upgraded/imported to the 2023 version, which is now in this repo.
